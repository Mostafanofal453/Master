## Project's Title

Reinforcement Q-Learning with OpenAI Gym



## Project Description

There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters), and our job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off at another. We receive +20 points for a successful drop-off and lose 1 point for every time-step it takes. There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.

Used techniques
- Brute force approach

- Q-Learning approach with decay over episodes

- Q-Learning approach with grid search
